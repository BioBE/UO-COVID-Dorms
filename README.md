## Abstract: 
The indoor environment is the primary location for the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), largely driven by respiratory particle accumulation in the air and increased connectivity between the individuals occupying indoor spaces. While significant effort has been made to characterize the environmental contamination associated with built environments occupied by COVID-19 positive individuals, these efforts have been undertaken as a single time point with minimal background on the individual occupying the space or the physical attributes of the space. In this study, we aimed to track a cohort of subjects as they occupied a COVID-19 isolation dormitory to better understand the impact of subject viral load, symptoms, and room ventilation on the detectable viral load within a single room. Nasal swabs, mouth swabs, surface swabs, passive settling plates, and active air samples were collected multiple times a day for several consecutive days to understand the longitudinal dynamics of viral shedding and environmental contamination. Overall, we present a detailed longitudinal analysis of human and environmental viral loads associated with individuals in quarantine. We find that subject samples demonstrate a decrease in overall viral load and percent positivity in environmental samples over time. Based upon the self-reported symptoms of study participants, we find that coughing and gastrointestinal symptoms most strongly correlate with increased environmental contamination and find significant differences in environmental contamination between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Lastly, we provide the first real-world evidence for decreased aerosol viral load with increasing ventilation, both from mechanical and window sources. These results are directly applicable to those occupying common spaces with an individual known to be positive for COVID-19 and may be used to better control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within built environments and better protect those caring for individuals with COVID-19.
